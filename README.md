# Coffee_Machine

**About:**
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee-machine simulator. The machine works with quite typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. The machine can make three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

**Result:**
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. An important part of Java are classes, and this is what you will practice here. Try yourself at working with loops and conditions and get more confident in Java programming.
